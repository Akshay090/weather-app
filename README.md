# How to Run the React Weather App

The Weather App displays the weather at the user's current location (provided that the user grants permission).
It fetches live weather data from the [APIXU](http://www.apixu.com) weather service.

Please note, to display the background images add blockers may need to be turned off.

To run the application enter the following command:

npm i then do 
```
npm start
```
